HPF similarly afforded fluorescein upon reaction with hROS only. Therefore, not only can hROS be differentiated from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO), and superoxide (O) by using HPF or APF alone, but −OCl can also be specifically detected by using HPF and APF together.

Fridovich identified CuZnSOD in 1969 and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in 1973, and proposed �the Superoxide Theory,� which postulates that superoxide (O2�−) is the origin of most reac tive oxygen species (ROS) and that it undergoes a chain reaction in a cell, playing a central role in the ROS producing system. Increased oxidative stress on an organism causes damage to cells, the smallest constituent unit of an organism, which can lead to the onset of a variety of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer�s, Parkinson�s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurological diseases caused by abnormalities in biological defenses or increased intracellular reactive oxygen levels. Oxidative stress also plays a role in aging. Antioxidant systems, including non enzyme low molecular weight antioxidants (such as, vitamins A, C and E, polyphenols, glutathione, and coenzyme Q10) and anti oxidant enzymes, fight against oxidants in cells. Superoxide is considered to be a major factor in oxidant toxicity, and mitochon drial MnSOD enzymes constitute an essential defense against superoxide. Mitochondria are the major source of superoxide. The reaction of superoxide generated from mitochondria with nitric oxide is faster than SOD catalyzed reaction, and produces per oxynitrite. Thus, based on research conducted after Fridovich�s seminal studies, we now propose a modified superoxide��",

Manganese superoxide dismutase removes superoxide radicals in mitochondria, and thus protects mitochondria from oxidative injury.

In 1997, a therapy-dedicated cyclotron was installed in the NCCHE at Kashiwa3). Between April and September of 1998, we investigated the biological effectiveness of therapeutic proton beams for cell lethality. Three cell lines, including human origin, were used for in vitro colony formation, while mouse gut crypt survivals provided in vivo response after a single dose of irradiation with 235 MeV proton beams. This energy of protons is used in clinical practice, because the beam intensity is sufficiently high for therapy, and because the depth doses in multiportal irradiation are quite achievable. We used linac 6 MV X rays as a reference beam to obtain proton RBE, which would provide more relevance to clinical practice than low-energy X rays or Co-60 γ rays.

The RPE cells were cultured and exposed by blue (470 nm) LED at 4.8 mW/cm2. The cellular viability was determined by XTT assay and cellular injury was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase activity in medium. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined by confocal laser microscope image analysis using dihydrorhodamine 123 and lipid peroxidation was determined by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal protein-adducts immunofluorescent staining (HNE).

In this review, we document that pain symptoms of the TMJ and MM regions in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are associated with computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) findings of internal derangement, joint effusion, osteoarthritis, and bone marrow edema. However, it is emphasized that these imaging findings must not be regarded as the unique and dominant factors in defining TMJ pain. High signal intensity and prominent enhancement of the posterior disk attachment on fat saturation T2-weighted imaging and dynamic MR imaging with contrast material are closely correlated with the severity of TMJ pain. Magnetic transfer contrast, MR spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and ultrasonography findings have helped��",

In addition, the levels of mitochondrial ROS were consistently found to always correlate with the levels of authentic MnSOD in mitochondria.

Tumor invasion is the most important factor to decide patient�s prognosis. The relation between reactive oxygen species and tumor invasion is mainly reported that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase in the cell membrane is a reactive oxygen species producer for formulating an invadopodia. On the other hand, mitochondrion was known as one of the most impor tant reactive oxygen species producer in the cell via an energy transfer system. However, the relation between mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the tumor invasion was not well clar ified. In this study, we evaluated the relation between mitochon drial reactive oxygen species and tumor invasion using a normal gastric mucosal cell line (RGM 1) and a cancerous mutant RGM 1 cell line (RGK 1). Manganese superoxide dismutase expressing RGK 1 cell lines were used for a scavenging mitochondrial reac tive oxygen species. The cells have been evaluated their move ment ability as follows; cellular ruffling frequencies, wound healing assay to evaluate horizontal cellular migration, and inva sion assay using matrigel to analyze vertical cellular migration. All cellular movement abilities were inhibited by scavenging mito chondrial reactive oxygen species with manganese superoxide dismutase. Therefore mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was one of factors enhancing the tumor invasion in gastric cancer.",

        "description": "The relationship between changes in retinal vessel morphology and the onset and progression of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) has been the subject of several large scale clinical studies. However, the difficulty of quantifying changes in retinal vessels in a sufficiently fast, accurate and repeatable manner has restricted the application of the insights gleaned from these studies to clinical practice. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the efficient detection and measurement of retinal vessels, which is general enough that it can be applied to both low and high resolution fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms upon the adjustment of only a few intuitive parameters. Firstly, we describe the simple vessel segmentation strategy, formulated in the language of wavelets, that is used for fast vessel detection. When validated using a publicly available database of retinal images, this segmentation achieves a true positive rate of 70.27%, false positive rate of 2.83%, and accuracy score of 0.9371. Vessel edges are then more precisely localised using image profiles computed perpendicularly across a spline fit of each detected vessel centreline, so that both local and global changes in vessel diameter can be readily quantified. Using a second image database, we show that the diameters output by our algorithm display good agreement with the manual measurements made by three independent observers. We conclude that the improved speed and generality offered by our algorithm are achieved without sacrificing accuracy. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB along with a graphical user��",

Higher concentrations slightly depolarised these neurones and reduced their input resistances (Ri), presumably a spontaneous activation of the inhibitory conductance. The excitatory potentials were also depressed. Ketamine, halothane and urethane doubled the i.p.s.c. duration. Higher concentrations depressed synaptic activity and the action potential, as did lignocaine. Ketamine also increased Ri.

In the present study, we examined BK channel function in retinal vascular smooth muscle cells from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The BK channel inhibitor, Penitrem A, constricted nondiabetic retinal arterioles (pressurized to 70mmHg) by 28%.

        "description": "Smoking and asbestos exposure are important risks for lung cancer. Several epidemiological studies have linked asbestos exposure and smoking to lung cancer. To reconcile and unify these results, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a quantitative estimate of the increased risk of lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking and to classify their interaction. Five electronic databases were searched from inception to May, 2015 for observational studies on lung cancer. All case-control (N = 10) and cohort (N = 7) studies were included in the analysis. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model for the association of asbestos exposure and smoking with lung cancer. Lung cancer patients who were not exposed to asbestos and non-smoking (A-S-) were compared with; (i) asbestos-exposed and non-smoking (A+S-), (ii) non-exposure to asbestos and smoking (A-S+), and (iii) asbestos-exposed and smoking (A+S+). Our meta-analysis showed a significant difference in risk of developing lung cancer among asbestos exposed and/or smoking workers compared to controls (A-S-), odds ratios for the disease (95% CI) were (i) 1.70 (A+S-, 1.31�2.21), (ii) 5.65; (A-S+, 3.38�9.42), (iii) 8.70 (A+S+, 5.8�13.10). The additive interaction index of synergy was 1.44 (95% CI = 1.26�1.77) and the multiplicative index = 0.91 (95% CI = 0.63�1.30). Corresponding values for cohort studies were 1.11 (95% CI = 1.00�1.28) and 0.51 (95% CI = 0.31�0.85). Our results point to an additive synergism for lung cancer with co-exposure of��",

While the exact pathogenic basis of this condition remains ill defined, it is clear that hyperglycaemia is a critical factor in its aetiology. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation is one of the sequelae of hyperglycaemia and it is thought to play an important role in the development of diabetic complications. This review questions the currently held dogma that PKC stimulation in diabetes is solely mediated through the overproduction of palmitate and oleate enriched diacylglycerols. Blood glucose concentrations are closely tracked by changes in the levels of free fatty acids and these, in addition to oxidative stress, may account for the aberrant activation of PKCs in diabetes.

The TRPM8 cation channel has been extensively investigated as a major neuronal cold sensor but is also activated by voltage, calcium store depletion, and some lipids as well as by compounds that produce cooling sensations, such as menthol or icilin. Several models of TRPM8 activation have been proposed to explain the interaction between these diverse stimuli.

Fridovich identified CuZnSOD in 1969 and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in 1973, and proposed �the Superoxide Theory,� which postulates that superoxide (O2�−) is the origin of most reac tive oxygen species (ROS) and that it undergoes a chain reaction in a cell, playing a central role in the ROS producing system. Increased oxidative stress on an organism causes damage to cells, the smallest constituent unit of an organism, which can lead to the onset of a variety of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer�s, Parkinson�s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurological diseases caused by abnormalities in biological defenses or increased intracellular reactive oxygen levels. Oxidative stress also plays a role in aging. Antioxidant systems, including non enzyme low molecular weight antioxidants (such as, vitamins A, C and E, polyphenols, glutathione, and coenzyme Q10) and anti oxidant enzymes, fight against oxidants in cells. Superoxide is considered to be a major factor in oxidant toxicity, and mitochon drial MnSOD enzymes constitute an essential defense against superoxide. Mitochondria are the major source of superoxide. The reaction of superoxide generated from mitochondria with nitric oxide is faster than SOD catalyzed reaction, and produces per oxynitrite. Thus, based on research conducted after Fridovich�s seminal studies, we now propose a modified superoxide��",

MnSOD activity is reduced in many transformed cells and tumor tissues. We previously showed that the reduced level of MnSOD activity in cancer cells was not due to a defect in the primary structure of MnSOD protein, but rather was due to defects in gene expression. To elucidate the cause for the reduced expression of human MnSOD in cancer, we investigated the nucleotide sequence in the regulatory region of the MnSOD gene in a normal human cell line and various human tumor cell lines. A DNA fragment spanning 3.4 kb 5′ flanking region of the MnSOD gene isolated from a normal human genomic DNA library was used to determine the DNA sequence of MnSOD promoter. PCR primers were used for amplification of the 3.4 kb 5′ flanking region of the human MnSOD gene in��",

The number of proton-therapy facilities in the world has increased in number from 5 to 16 within the last 10 years2), and high tumor control rates for localized tumors, including retinal malignant melanomas, have been reported. In 1997, a therapy-dedicated cyclotron was installed in the NCCHE at Kashiwa3). Between April and September of 1998, we investigated the biological effectiveness of therapeutic proton beams for cell lethality. Three cell lines, including human origin, were used for in vitro colony formation, while mouse gut crypt survivals provided in vivo response after a single dose of irradiation with 235 MeV proton beams. This energy of protons is used in clinical practice, because the beam intensity is sufficiently high for therapy, and because the depth doses in multiportal irradiation are quite achievable. We used linac 6 MV X rays as a reference beam to obtain proton RBE, which would provide more relevance to clinical practice than low-energy X rays or Co-60 γ rays. We proposed an RBE of 1.1 for 235 MeV proton beams with 10-cm SOBP at the NCCHE.",

Tumor invasion is the most important factor to decide patient�s prognosis. The relation between reactive oxygen species and tumor invasion is mainly reported that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase in the cell membrane is a reactive oxygen species producer for formulating an invadopodia. On the other hand, mitochondrion was known as one of the most impor tant reactive oxygen species producer in the cell via an energy transfer system. However, the relation between mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the tumor invasion was not well clar ified. In this study, we evaluated the relation between mitochon drial reactive oxygen species and tumor invasion using a normal gastric mucosal cell line (RGM 1) and a cancerous mutant RGM 1 cell line (RGK 1). Manganese superoxide dismutase expressing RGK 1 cell lines were used for a scavenging mitochondrial reac tive oxygen species. The cells have been evaluated their move ment ability as follows; cellular ruffling frequencies, wound healing assay to evaluate horizontal cellular migration, and inva sion assay using matrigel to analyze vertical cellular migration. All cellular movement abilities were inhibited by scavenging mito chondrial reactive oxygen species with manganese superoxide dismutase. Therefore mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was one of factors enhancing the tumor invasion in gastric cancer.",

        "description": "The relationship between changes in retinal vessel morphology and the onset and progression of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) has been the subject of several large scale clinical studies. However, the difficulty of quantifying changes in retinal vessels in a sufficiently fast, accurate and repeatable manner has restricted the application of the insights gleaned from these studies to clinical practice. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the efficient detection and measurement of retinal vessels, which is general enough that it can be applied to both low and high resolution fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms upon the adjustment of only a few intuitive parameters. Firstly, we describe the simple vessel segmentation strategy, formulated in the language of wavelets, that is used for fast vessel detection. When validated using a publicly available database of retinal images, this segmentation achieves a true positive rate of 70.27%, false positive rate of 2.83%, and accuracy score of 0.9371. Vessel edges are then more precisely localised using image profiles computed perpendicularly across a spline fit of each detected vessel centreline, so that both local and global changes in vessel diameter can be readily quantified. Using a second image database, we show that the diameters output by our algorithm display good agreement with the manual measurements made by three independent observers.

Higher concentrations slightly depolarised these neurones and reduced their input resistances (Ri), presumably a spontaneous activation of the inhibitory conductance. The excitatory potentials were also depressed. Ketamine, halothane and urethane doubled the i.p.s.c. duration. Higher concentrations depressed synaptic activity and the action potential, as did lignocaine. Ketamine also increased Ri. These results confirm the idea that these compounds produced anaesthesia by prolonging inhibition (accompanied by a depression of the e.p.s.p. with some anaesthetics).",

        "description": "Smoking and asbestos exposure are important risks for lung cancer. Several epidemiological studies have linked asbestos exposure and smoking to lung cancer. To reconcile and unify these results, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a quantitative estimate of the increased risk of lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking and to classify their interaction. Five electronic databases were searched from inception to May, 2015 for observational studies on lung cancer. All case-control (N = 10) and cohort (N = 7) studies were included in the analysis. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model for the association of asbestos exposure and smoking with lung cancer. Lung cancer patients who were not exposed to asbestos and non-smoking (A-S-) were compared with; (i) asbestos-exposed and non-smoking (A+S-), (ii) non-exposure to asbestos and smoking (A-S+), and (iii) asbestos-exposed and smoking (A+S+). Our meta-analysis showed a significant difference in risk of developing lung cancer among asbestos exposed and/or smoking workers compared to controls (A-S-), odds ratios for the disease (95% CI) were (i) 1.70 (A+S-, 1.31�2.21), (ii) 5.65; (A-S+, 3.38�9.42), (iii) 8.70 (A+S+, 5.8�13.10).

While the exact pathogenic basis of this condition remains ill defined, it is clear that hyperglycaemia is a critical factor in its aetiology. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation is one of the sequelae of hyperglycaemia and it is thought to play an important role in the development of diabetic complications. This review questions the currently held dogma that PKC stimulation in diabetes is solely mediated through the overproduction of palmitate and oleate enriched diacylglycerols. Blood glucose concentrations are closely tracked by changes in the levels of free fatty acids and these, in addition to oxidative stress, may account for the aberrant activation of PKCs in diabetes.

The TRPM8 cation channel has been extensively investigated as a major neuronal cold sensor but is also activated by voltage, calcium store depletion, and some lipids as well as by compounds that produce cooling sensations, such as menthol or icilin.

        "description": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi) provides traditional cognitive treatments possibly reflecting improved cerebral hemodynamics. Little is known about the cardiovascular actions of Brahmi. We sought to assess its effects on blood pressure and on isolated arteries, thus providing insights to clinical applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intravenous Brahmi (20�60mg/kg) was tested on arterial blood pressure and heart rate of anaesthetized rats. In vitro vasorelaxation was assessed in arteries, with and without blockers of nitric oxide synthase (L-NAME), cyclooxygenase (indomethacin), and mechanical de-endothelialisation. The effects of Brahmi on Ca2+ influx and release from stores were investigated. RESULTS: Intravenous Brahmi extract (20�60mg/kg) decreased systolic and diastolic pressures without affecting heart rate. Brahmi evoked relaxation in isolated arteries in��",

        "description": "Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. (Brahmi in India and Thailand) is an ayurvedic dementia treatment, but its effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF) is still unknown. We sought to test its chronic and acute effects on CBF compared with Ginkgo biloba and donepezil. CBF was measured by laser Doppler from rat cerebral cortex after 8 weeks of daily oral dosing of these drugs. Systolic blood pressure was also measured using the tail cuff method or via arterial cannulation. In rats treated with B. monnieri (40 mg/kg), CBF was 25% increased [2927 ± 123 perfusion units, (PU)] compared with shams (2337 ± 217 PU, p < 0.05, nine rats). G. biloba (60 mg/kg) also increased CBF (by 29% to 3019 ± 208 PU, p < 0.05, nine rats). No clear effect was obtained with donepezil (1 mg/kg). Chronic administration of the preparations had no effect on blood pressure. In contrast, intravenous acute infusion of these herbals (20�60��",

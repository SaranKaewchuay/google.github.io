        "description": "We present a comprehensive phylogeny derived from 5 genes, nucSSU, nucLSU rDNA, TEF1, RPB1 and RPB2, for 356 isolates and 41 families (six newly described in this volume) in Dothideomycetes. All currently accepted orders in the class are represented for the first time in addition to numerous previously unplaced lineages. Subclass Pleosporomycetidae is expanded to include the aquatic order Jahnulales. An ancestral reconstruction of basic nutritional modes supports numerous transitions from saprobic life histories to plant associated and lichenised modes and a transition from terrestrial to aquatic habitats are confirmed. Finally, a genomic comparison of 6 dothideomycete genomes with other fungi finds a high level of unique protein associated with the class, supporting its delineation as a separate taxon.",

The classification includes 530 species (in 321 genera) to order level: Ascomycota 424 species (in 251 genera), anamorphic fungi 94 species (in 61 genera) and Basidiomycota 12 species (in 9 genera). The Halosphaeriales is the largest order of marine fungi with 126 species in 53 genera, of which 35 are monotypic. Several taxa are of uncertain position and cannot be assigned to any higher taxonomic ranks. The decadel index shows that most marine fungi were described in the period 1980-1989 (135) and 1990-1999 (156), with 43 new species and 25 new genera from the past eight years. Keys are provided to the major taxa, genera and species. One new species is described in this paper.",

        "description": "Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular techniques, over the past 10�15�years, and continues to accelerate. Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes, it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately 6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which are lichen-forming.

One hundred and sixty endophytic fungi derived from Cymodocea serrulata (Family Cymodoceaceae), Halophila ovalis and Thalassia hemprichii (Family Hydrocharitaceae) were screened for production of antimicrobial compounds by a colorimetric broth microdilution test against ten human pathogenic microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Escherichia coli ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and NCPF 3153, Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC 90112 and ATCC 90113 and clinical isolates of Microsporum gypseum and Penicillium marneffei. Sixty-nine percent of the isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one test strain. Antifungal activity was more pronounced than antibacterial activity. Among the active fungi, seven isolates including Hypocreales sp. PSU-ES26 from C. serrulata, Trichoderma spp. PSU-ES8 and PSU-ES38 from H. ovalis, and Penicillium sp. PSU-ES43, Fusarium sp. PSU-ES73, Stephanonectria sp.

To investigate the mechanism underlying STAT3 deregulation in HNSCC, we examined the interplay of the STAT3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways using a panel of HNSCC cell lines. Although STAT3 was active in most HNSCC cell lines, only 3 of 10 HNSCC cell lines were moderately to strongly positive for activated EGFR. Even in the EGFR-positive cell lines, STAT3 activation was not dependent on EGFR activation, as STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation levels persisted after treatment with AG1478, a chemical inhibitor of EGFR activity.

We show here that Sema3E acts as a potent inhibitor of adult and tumor-induced angiogenesis. Activation of plexin D1 by Sema3E causes the rapid disassembly of integrin-mediated adhesive structures, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and causing the retraction of filopodia in endothelial tip cells. Sema3E acts on plexin D1 to initiate a two-pronged mechanism involving R-Ras inactivation and Arf6 stimulation, which affect the status of activation of integrins and their intracellular trafficking, respectively.

Among the multiple dysregulated molecular mechanism in HNSCCs, emerging basic, preclinical, and clinical findings support the importance of the mTOR signaling route in HNSCC progression. Indeed, we observed here that the activation of mTOR is a widespread event in clinical specimens of HNSCCs invading locoregional lymph nodes.

Histamine causes the rapid formation of focal adherens junctions, disrupting the endothelial barrier by acting on H1R Gαq-coupled receptors, which is blunted in endothelial Gαq/11 KO mice.

Furthermore, when expressed in the epidermis of mice, mutant ras promotes the formation of benign papillomas, only few of which will progress into carcinomas. However, in these cases, ras-transgene expression often is restricted to suprabasal or follicular epithelial cells that may lack self-renewal capacity. Thus, it still is conceivable that expression of active ras in other epithelial compartments may exert a distinct ability to promote malignant progression.

Here, we have focused on the role of the family of mitogen activated kinases (MAPKs), extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK in HNSCC. Immunohistochemical analysis of a large collection of human HNSCC tissues revealed that the levels of the phosphorylated active form of ERK1/2 and JNK were elevated in less than 33% and 16% of the cases, respectively. Strikingly, however, high levels of active phospho-p38 were observed in most (79%) of hundreds of tissues analyzed.

Fridovich identified CuZnSOD in 1969 and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in 1973, and proposed �the Superoxide Theory,� which postulates that superoxide (O2�−) is the origin of most reac tive oxygen species (ROS) and that it undergoes a chain reaction in a cell, playing a central role in the ROS producing system. Increased oxidative stress on an organism causes damage to cells, the smallest constituent unit of an organism, which can lead to the onset of a variety of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer�s, Parkinson�s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurological diseases caused by abnormalities in biological defenses or increased intracellular reactive oxygen levels. Oxidative stress also plays a role in aging. Antioxidant systems, including non enzyme low molecular weight antioxidants (such as, vitamins A, C and E, polyphenols, glutathione, and coenzyme Q10) and anti oxidant enzymes, fight against oxidants in cells. Superoxide is considered to be a major factor in oxidant toxicity, and mitochon drial MnSOD enzymes constitute an essential defense against superoxide. Mitochondria are the major source of superoxide. The reaction of superoxide generated from mitochondria with nitric oxide is faster than SOD catalyzed reaction, and produces per oxynitrite. Thus, based on research conducted after Fridovich�s seminal studies, we now propose a modified superoxide��",

Oxidative stress is thought to be implicated in the cytotoxicity of MCLR, but the mechanisms by which MCLR produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) are still unclear. This study investigated the role and possible sources of ROS generation in MCLR-induced cytogenotoxicity in HepG2, a human hepatoma cell line. MCLR increased DNA strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxiguanosine formation, lipid peroxidation, as well as LDH release, all of which were inhibited by ROS scavengers.

Particle radiotherapy is currently attractive for oncologists as a new and promising modality to treat malignant tumors. The number of proton-therapy facilities in the world has increased in number from 5 to 16 within the last 10 years2), and high tumor control rates for localized tumors, including retinal malignant melanomas, have been reported. In 1997, a therapy-dedicated cyclotron was installed in the NCCHE at Kashiwa3). Between April and September of 1998, we investigated the biological effectiveness of therapeutic proton beams for cell lethality. Three cell lines, including human origin, were used for in vitro colony formation, while mouse gut crypt survivals provided in vivo response after a single dose of irradiation with 235 MeV proton beams. This energy of protons is used in clinical practice, because the beam intensity is sufficiently high for therapy, and because the depth doses in multiportal irradiation are quite achievable. We used linac 6 MV X rays as a reference beam to obtain proton RBE, which would provide more relevance to clinical practice than low-energy X rays or Co-60 γ rays. We proposed an RBE of 1.1 for 235 MeV proton beams with 10-cm SOBP at the NCCHE.",

Tumor invasion is the most important factor to decide patient�s prognosis. The relation between reactive oxygen species and tumor invasion is mainly reported that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase in the cell membrane is a reactive oxygen species producer for formulating an invadopodia. On the other hand, mitochondrion was known as one of the most impor tant reactive oxygen species producer in the cell via an energy transfer system. However, the relation between mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the tumor invasion was not well clar ified. In this study, we evaluated the relation between mitochon drial reactive oxygen species and tumor invasion using a normal gastric mucosal cell line (RGM 1) and a cancerous mutant RGM 1 cell line (RGK 1). Manganese superoxide dismutase expressing RGK 1 cell lines were used for a scavenging mitochondrial reac tive oxygen species. The cells have been evaluated their move ment ability as follows; cellular ruffling frequencies, wound healing assay to evaluate horizontal cellular migration, and inva sion assay using matrigel to analyze vertical cellular migration. All cellular movement abilities were inhibited by scavenging mito chondrial reactive oxygen species with manganese superoxide dismutase. Therefore mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was one of factors enhancing the tumor invasion in gastric cancer.",

        "description": "The relationship between changes in retinal vessel morphology and the onset and progression of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) has been the subject of several large scale clinical studies. However, the difficulty of quantifying changes in retinal vessels in a sufficiently fast, accurate and repeatable manner has restricted the application of the insights gleaned from these studies to clinical practice. This paper presents a novel algorithm for the efficient detection and measurement of retinal vessels, which is general enough that it can be applied to both low and high resolution fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms upon the adjustment of only a few intuitive parameters. Firstly, we describe the simple vessel segmentation strategy, formulated in the language of wavelets, that is used for fast vessel detection. When validated using a publicly available database of retinal images, this segmentation achieves a true positive rate of 70.27%, false positive rate of 2.83%, and accuracy score of 0.9371. Vessel edges are then more precisely localised using image profiles computed perpendicularly across a spline fit of each detected vessel centreline, so that both local and global changes in vessel diameter can be readily quantified. Using a second image database, we show that the diameters output by our algorithm display good agreement with the manual measurements made by three independent observers. We conclude that the improved speed and generality offered by our algorithm are achieved without sacrificing accuracy. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB along with a graphical user��",

Nine days after bulbectomy there was a significant decrease in content of aspartate (31%) and glutamate (20%) in olfactory cortex but no change in neocortex. The content of GABA, alanine and ACh in olfactory cortex was unchanged (± 3 per cent of control). The content of 5‐HT, dopamine, NE and glycine was increased by 10‐18 per cent. The decrease in aspartate and glutamate content of the olfactory cortex after bulbectomy suggests that these two amino acids have a high concentration in fibres of the lateral olfactory tract.

        "description": "Smoking and asbestos exposure are important risks for lung cancer. Several epidemiological studies have linked asbestos exposure and smoking to lung cancer. To reconcile and unify these results, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a quantitative estimate of the increased risk of lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking and to classify their interaction. Five electronic databases were searched from inception to May, 2015 for observational studies on lung cancer. All case-control (N = 10) and cohort (N = 7) studies were included in the analysis. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model for the association of asbestos exposure and smoking with lung cancer. Lung cancer patients who were not exposed to asbestos and non-smoking (A-S-) were compared with; (i) asbestos-exposed and non-smoking (A+S-), (ii) non-exposure to asbestos and smoking (A-S+), and (iii) asbestos-exposed and smoking (A+S+). Our meta-analysis showed a significant difference in risk of developing lung cancer among asbestos exposed and/or smoking workers compared to controls (A-S-), odds ratios for the disease (95% CI) were (i) 1.70 (A+S-, 1.31�2.21), (ii) 5.65; (A-S+, 3.38�9.42), (iii) 8.70 (A+S+, 5.8�13.10).

While the exact pathogenic basis of this condition remains ill defined, it is clear that hyperglycaemia is a critical factor in its aetiology. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation is one of the sequelae of hyperglycaemia and it is thought to play an important role in the development of diabetic complications. This review questions the currently held dogma that PKC stimulation in diabetes is solely mediated through the overproduction of palmitate and oleate enriched diacylglycerols. Blood glucose concentrations are closely tracked by changes in the levels of free fatty acids and these, in addition to oxidative stress, may account for the aberrant activation of PKCs in diabetes.

The TRPM8 cation channel has been extensively investigated as a major neuronal cold sensor but is also activated by voltage, calcium store depletion, and some lipids as well as by compounds that produce cooling sensations, such as menthol or icilin. Several models of TRPM8 activation have been proposed to explain the interaction between these diverse stimuli.

        "description": "Lipid oxidation and myoglobin oxidation in muscle foods occur in a concurrent manner and each process appears to enhance the other. During oxidation of oxymyoglobin, both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide are produced and further react with iron to produce hydroxyl radical. The hydroxyl radical has the ability to penetrate into the hydrophobic lipid region and hence facilitates lipid oxidation. The prooxidant effect of oxymyoglobin on lipid oxidation is concentrationdependent. At equimolar concentrations, oxymyoglobin shows higher prooxidative activity towards lipid than metmyoglobin. However, the catalytic activity of metmyoglobin is promoted by hydrogen peroxide. The reaction between hydrogen peroxide and metmyoglobin results in the formation of two active hypervalent myoglobin species, perferrylmyoglobin and ferrylmyoglobin, which are responsible for lipid oxidation. Additionally, lipid oxidation results in a wide range of aldehyde products, which are reported to induce the oxidation of oxymyoglobin. Metmyoglobin formation is generally greater in the presence of unsaturated aldehydes than their saturated counterparts of equivalent carbon chain length. In addition, increasing chain length of aldehydes, from hexenal through nonenal, results in the increased metmyoglobin formation. Moreover, aldehydes alter myoglobin redox stability by increasing oxymyoglobin oxidation, decreasing the metmyoglobin reduction via enzymatic process, and enhance the prooxidant activity of metmyoglobin. Therefore, the oxidation of both lipid and myoglobin directly affect the quality and acceptability of muscle foods and the lowering of such a��",

Modulation of the cardiomyocyte redox state in genetically engineered mice by modulation of enzymes involved in metabolism of ROS/RNS, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), or a combination of these, regulated levels of mitochondrial/nuclear p53 in cardiomyocytes after ADR administration.

Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels is commonly used as a medicinal plant and is claimed to have antioxidant activities. The effects of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels aqueous extract (SCC) on antifree radical, anti-inflammation, and antiulcer of SCC on indomethacin induced acute gastric ulceration were determined in our study. Scavenging activity at 50% of SCC is higher than ascorbic acid in in vitro study. Mice treated with indomethacin revealed mucosal hemorrhagic lesion and inhibited mucus content. Pretreatment with SCC caused discernible decrease in indomethacin induced gastric lesion and lipid peroxide content. In addition, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), nitric oxide (NO) levels, and gastric wall mucus were restored on acute treated mice model. Indomethacin induced inflammation by activated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) proinflammatory cytokines to release large amount of ROS/RNS which were ameliorated in mice pretreatment with SCC. SCC showed restoration of the imbalance of oxidative damage leading to amelioration of cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX). In conclusion, SCC acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and antiulcer against indomethacin.",

        "description": "Diabetes is the most common epidemic disease worldwide. In the world, approximately 422 million adult people (up to 2014) are living with diabetes mellitus. Type II diabetes is much more common than type I. Diabetes type II not only affects the adult population, but also children [WHO, 2016]. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder, which is correlated with abnormalities of glucose, lipid and protein homeostasis [Van den Berghe et al., 2006]. High glucose levels generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body via several pathways, such as glucose autoxidation, the polyol pathway and production of advanced glycation end products [Bonnefont-Rousselot, 2002]. Increased ROS production leads to cellular and organ damage including the liver, kidney and pancreas by lipid peroxidation and reduced antioxidant enzyme activity [Das & Sil, 2012]. The liver is a large organ of the body which plays a major role in lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and stores glucose as glycogen [Nguyen et al., 2008]. Increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities are liver injury biomarkers and are higher in diabetics [Sivakrishnan & Kottaimuthu, 2014]. Liver plays a significant role in blood glucose homeostasis via uptaking elevated concentration of glucose from blood and its storage as glycogen; and additionally produces glucose for circulation by glycogenolysis under starvation conditions [Sherwin, 1980]. In type II diabetes, glucose uptake decreases via a glu-",

        "description": "Developed herein are the scaling laws for physical modeling of anti-symmetric cross-ply laminated circular cylindrical shells for buckling and free vibration experiments. In the absence of experimental data, the validity of the scaling laws is verified by numerical experiments. This is accomplished by calculating theoretically the buckling loads and fundamental frequencies of the model and substituting into the scaling laws to obtain the corresponding values of the prototype. The predicted values of the prototype from the scaling laws are then compared with existing closed-form solutions. Examples for the complete similitude cases with various stacking sequences, number of plies, and length-to-radius ratios show exact agreement. The derived relationships between the model and prototype will greatly facilitate and reduce the need for costly experiments. In reality, either due to the complexity of the scaling laws or to��",

The governing equation of motion of the beam, which includes the effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia based on the Timoshenko beam theory, is derived from Lagrange�s equations. The Ritz and Newmark methods are employed to solve the equation of motion for the free and forced vibration responses of the beam with different boundary conditions. The results are presented in both tabular and graphical forms to show the effects of layer thickness ratios, boundary conditions, length to height ratios, spring constants, etc. on natural frequencies and dynamic deflections of the beam.

The experiments were conducted over a 1DEA2P concentration range of 120�751 mol/m3, and a temperature range of 298�313 K. As 1DEA2P is a tertiary amine, the base‐catalyzed hydration mechanism was, then, applied to correlate the experimental CO2 absorption rate constants obtained from stopped‐flow apparatus. In addition, the pKa of 1DEA2P was experimentally measured over a temperature range of 278�333 K. The Brønsted relationship between reaction rate constant (obtained from stopped‐flow apparatus) and pKa was, then, studied.

Rafting of the γ′ structure occurs rapidly, e.g. for the 1150°C/100MPa tests rafting is completed within the first 10h. At this stage and for a considerable time thereafter the creep strain rate decreases with increasing strain, implying a creep hardening effect which is absent at lower temperatures when the kinetics of rafting is less rapid. Once a critical strain ε* of (0.7±0.3)% is reached, the creep strain increases dramatically and failure occurs within a few tens of hours. It is demonstrated that methods of interpretation which, assume a proportionality between the creep strain rate and creep strain, are unable to account for creep hardening which occurs as a consequence of rafting.

For strains smaller than ϵth, rafting occurs exceedingly slowly; once ϵth is exceeded the kinetics are largely unaffected by the absence of applied stress. The magnitude of ϵth confers a reduction in γ/γ′ interfacial coherency and a relaxation of interfacial misfit stresses.

Seven small-scale short columns (125 mm x 125 mm x 600 mm) with different type of reinforcements were tested under concentric loading to investigate strength capacity and ductility. The results showed that the strength capacity of short columns reinforced by bamboo without surface treatment could resist the axial load as structurally required by ACI318-05, but ductility was rather low especially the column that was reinforced by 1.6 percent of reinforcing bamboo which showed brittle behavior similar to that of plain concrete column. This was thought to be an effect of water absorption and a loss of bonding strength between concrete and bamboo. On the other hand, columns reinforced by bamboo treated with water-repellent substance, Sikadur-31CFN, showed higher strength and ductility than columns reinforced by untreated bamboo. The result also showed that 1.6% of steel reinforcement, in relation to the column crosssection, could be replaced by 3.2% of treated reinforcing bamboo, for similar behavior, strength and ductility.",

        "description": "Caffeine is a widely known food constituent. Coffee and tea are major sources of caffeine. However, there is little data about caffeine's antimicrobial activity. Although caffeine is safe for the consumer and suitable as an antimicrobial agent in food, ingesting a lot of caffeine will affect the body (> 400 mg day-1). As a result, legislation has defined the amount of caffeine to be used in various food products. In term of antimicrobial activity, caffeine at concentration from 62.5 to > 2,000 µg⋅ ml-1 could inhibit bacteria. In addition, higher amount of caffeine (> 5,000 µg⋅ ml-1) was found to inhibit mold growth.",

        "description": "The paper presents the structural and environmentally sustainable aspects of bamboo as a reinforcing material instead of steel reinforcement in concrete columns. Seven small-scale short columns (125 mm x 125 mm x 600 mm) with different type of reinforcements were tested under concentric loading to investigate strength capacity and ductility. The results showed that the strength capacity of short columns reinforced by bamboo without surface treatment could resist the axial load as structurally required by ACI318-05, but ductility was rather low especially the column that was reinforced by 1.6 percent of reinforcing bamboo which showed brittle behavior similar to that of plain concrete column. This was thought to be an effect of water absorption and a loss of bonding strength between concrete and bamboo. On the other hand, columns reinforced by bamboo treated with water-repellent substance, Sikadur-31CFN, showed higher strength and ductility than columns reinforced by untreated bamboo. The result also showed that 1.6% of steel reinforcement, in relation to the column crosssection, could be replaced by 3.2% of treated reinforcing bamboo, for similar behavior, strength and ductility.",
